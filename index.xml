      <description>A little late to the party, but here nevertheless, I am finally taking anthonygrimes.co.uk to the next phase.
Gone are the static files, bye bye to html and to editing .scss files or manually creating directories, gone are all the headaches and timesinks of the old static webpage and hello to Hugo.
What is Hugo? Hugo is a beautifully simple framework for building websites. Just like this one!
Powerful, extensible and as easy as selecting a theme and going.</description>
